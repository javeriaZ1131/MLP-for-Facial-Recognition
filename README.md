# MLP-for-Facial-Recognition
Apply the MLP for digit recognization and perform the complete analysis of this implementation in terms of calculation accuracy,recall and percision. and also the output is also displayed.
        
Step 1
Firstly we will load   the dataset which in this case is the facial expression of 5 different emotions which are stored in the Data.zip file.Firstly the zip file is extracted.
Step 2:
Now load the data from the  folder containing the image folders of 6 different  facial expression emoticons in an image list.
 

Step 3:

Now we will create the training dataset from the given data  where all those images which are not 100 X 100 will be cleaned.
 




Step 4
Splitting of the training data into train and test var. Where test data will be the on on which predictions will be performed.
 
Step 5
Categories are labels as 0-6
 
Step 6
Multi layer perceptron implementation with keras is done where the MLP is created with 2 hidden layers and 1 input and 1 output layer. Input layer have 512 nodes will rest have 600 nodes in order to get efficient results.
 


Step 7
Now the computed accuracy of the result  shows that 57% percent of the data is predicted correctly . 
 
 

Step 8
On computing the precision and the recall we get that precision of data prediction is 55% and recall is 57% 
 

That was all about the working. Hope you find it easy to grasp.	

Thankss!!!!
